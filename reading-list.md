# Reading List
## Long Reads

* Patrick Kua *[Talking With Tech Leads](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014Q2C4M4/)* - draws on a variety of tech leads at ThoughtWorks and their fairly well defined tech lead role as well other tech leads in the industry. (Of note, we offer a different, broader definition of a tech lead in the Tech Lead Coaching Network from Kua.)

## Shorter Reads

* In [What’s the role of a tech lead? – Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/whats-the-role-of-a-tech-lead-7725b47104b7), Pawel Ledwon of Pusher offers three principles to guide tech leads: “leading with company values [and] delivering value to customers."
