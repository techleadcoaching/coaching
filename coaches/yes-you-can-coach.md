# Chapter One: Yes You -- Even YOU -- Can Coach

If you are interested in coaching, I wish I could sit right next to you right now and talk you through it because you are in many ways the most important part of the network. 

I also suspect I would love to spend some time with you because I think I know something about you. That is, just by the fact that you are reading this, I bet there is something wonderful about you and your desire to give back and be an impactful part of others lives. 

This guide starts with a feeling that most new coaches are feeling: can I actually be a coach to other tech leads? The short answer is you absolutely can. Read on for more detail.

## What Coaching is NOT in the Tech Lead Coaching Network

One major source of anxiety about coaching for new tech lead coaches is that they have assumptions about who coaches are and what coaches do, thoughts that are inconsistent with the approch we take at the Tech Lead Coaching Network. 

For example, when you think of a coach, your first thought might be sports. You may imagine a coach screaming at players from the sidelines, directing them what to do. For some reason, I tend to imagine Bill Bellichik, the six time New England Patriots coach, scowling at his players no matter whether the team is winning or losing. Or maybe you might also think of a coach in a gym or training program. You might imagine the coach watching an athlete and correcting movements so the athelete can grow. 

If you are aware of some of the executive or life coaching program, you may even think of coaching as some kind activity that either only high level executives use or is some kind of "new agey" way of getting some kind of alternative therapy.

Coaching is of couse all those things in those contexts.

In the context of our Network community, however, coaching is none of those things.

## What Coaching IS 

If you notice most of the images most of have about coaching is the idea that the coach knows more about what to do than the coachee. That is, someone who is looking for coaching is almost like a student or someone who is supposed to do what the coach says. The image is likely one where the coach is supposed to solve someone's problems.

This is not the kind of coaching we do here.

Instead, as a coach in our community Network, we ask that **you not give any advice** or, most importantly, **do not try to solve your tech lead's problems**.

Remember that you and your tech lead are basically peers, your tech lead can solve his or her problems. All you need to do as a coach is listen closely, ask questions, and generally support and affirm your tech lead's choices. 

Most tech leads who are considering coaching, even those without many years of experience as a tech lead, are capable of listening and asking questions. So hopefully redefining and focusing your energy on this definition of coaching makes you feel confident that this is something you can actually do -- if you commit to it. 

## What Are The Main Skills?

Really, you just need two primary skills: be a strong listener and bring you tech lead experience into the community. 

### Listening

When you are listening to the tech lead, you will use empathic techniques. By this, we mean that you simply need to put your own needs aside for a while. 

The coaching conversation is one hundred percent about the tech lead you are coaching. You may feel needs to direct them, offer advice, solve problems, but these tendencies take you away from focusing on the tech lead; instead, those thoughts shift the focus to you as a coach, and this is the wrong place to focus on.

Instead, focus on what the tech lead is saying, be supportive, keep your own judgments out of your head (again, doing so shifts the focus to you) and ask yourself how this tech lead is going to solve his or her problems or overcome a challenge. 

Doing these things essentially gives your tech lead the sensation of being actually heard and able to air some thoughts and, the wonderful part about this, is that the tech lead will solve their own problems. It may not be the solution you would try, but remember, they are the ones who have to live this -- not you.

You may not be the strongest empathic listener right now, but I want you to see coaching through the Tech Lead Coaching Network as a unique opportunity to develop this skill. After all, it is a powerful skill that is useful in many contexts -- both professional and personal. 

### Experience
[Why we are starting with this concept - the main skill you need is not your technical skill and experience, you need to be a very strong listener  we do need your experience, however, because there are moments where you need (1) empathy and (2) you can't hear the right things if you haven't walked in their shoes and (3) sometimes you have ideas or advice, which is fine - ]

The second skill you need is that you do need some experiene as a tech lead. As the Tech Lead Coaching Network grows, its strength will be in the community and in the shared experiences we bring to it. 

If you were reading carefully, however, you may be wondering why I am emphasizing your experience when I just got done telling you that we do not want you offering advice or trying to solve your tech lead's problems. 

Taking that thought further, you may think that anyone could coach a tech lead if all they needed to do was listen. However, your experience as a tech lead is precisely what is going to make you an effective listener.

First, your tech lead may not feel comfortable seeking coaching from someone who has not walked where he or she has. Having that shared, peer experience creates a lot of instant connection and likely speeds up the time it takes to build trust between the two of you.

Second, you are not going to be an effective listener if you do not really understand what the tech lead's context and experience is. This makes it easier for you to listen with empathy because you have probably been in similar situations or could easily imagine being in them.

Finally, tapping into your experiences as a tech lead yourself makes it easier for you to ask effective questions. Some of those questions may be ways to guide or provide some direction (especially when using the model). But if you do not have experience as a tech lead, it is too hard for a coach to ask effective questions.

## In Summary

In summary, I hope that seeing the coaching process as simply one in which you ask questions takes some of the anxiety away from you. And I hope seeing your role as a coach as simply one who supports the tech lead who will solve his or her own problems, also makes you feel confident you can do this. 

Because you can.
