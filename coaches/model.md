# Chapter Three: The Tech Lead Coaching Model

In addition to the getting started guidance we offer in Chapter Two and the mechanics and logistics of the coaching conversations that we will explore in Chapter Four, the following section provides some specific guidance for coaches to focus conversations on. The focus is on the tech lead's maturity in certain skills.

While the conversations can go in any direction you want, we feel that using listening and questioning methods with your tech lead to focus on these five skills will grow their leadership cabilities in their tech lead careers so they have a bigger impact.

We call them "Pareto skills" based on the famous Pareto principle. If you have not heard it before, Vilfredo Pareto was an Italian economist who noticed that twenty percent of Italians owned eighty percent of the land. The Pareto principle was popularized as the 80/20 rule because it seems to hold in so many circumstances, such as the economics, sports, safety, crime, gambling, health care, and even software bug reports, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).

## The Five Pareto Skills
Following the Pareto theory just discussed, we believe the following five skills, if you work through them with your tech lead and help them grow their maturity within each of them, will produce strong results for them. They are not by any means all the skills a tech lead needs and surely some of your coaching conversations will deviate away from these topics, but we believe they are a great start and a great way to explore problems.

When in a coaching conversation, listen closely to your tech lead and note how effective they are with these skills:
1. The tech lead's ability to **listen** effectively to his or her team, organization, and management
2. How your tech lead **takes initiative** and ownership of the tasks or situations
3. Their effectiveness at **articulating a vision** for a project or situation
4. How you approach and execute the **tracking and adjusting** aspects of the tech lead role
5. Your own **growth mindset** as it pertains to yourself, your team, and your team's growth

Importantly, in Chapter Four we counsel you to focus your listening efforts on the tech lead's capabilities and not to try to dive in and solve their problems. Keeping the Tech Lead Coaching Model in front of you while talking with a tech lead will help you keep the focus where it needs to be.

## Summary of the Core Skills and Capabilities
The following table, still in progress, defines the core skills that we feel, if focused on, contribute strongly to an individual tech lead's impactfulness in the role. It may be helpful to print this off or keep it handy during your conversations.

You will notice that within each skill, we offer a maturity scale with some behaviors that may be markers of the tech lead's skill progression.

| Skill |  Beginners | Intermediate | Advanced |
|-------|--------------------|--------------|----------|
| Listening | Focuses on content | Synthesizes context + body language | Empathic understanding
| Taking Initiative | Occaisional w/ anxiety | Confident but too frequent | Restrained, focused, impactful |
| Vision | Unclear or uncompelling vision | Clarity w/o consistent messaging | Compelling, frequent communication |
| Tracking and Adjusting | Relies excessively on technology | Face to face; slow to adjust | Fluidly adjusts and anticipates |
| Individual Growth Mindset | Goal driven | Process driven | Grows team's capabilities |

The next section will explore each of the skills in more detail.

## The Core Tech Lead Pareto Skills in Detail

In this section, we give you tools to help develop these skills in your tech leads. First, we explore the dimensions of the skill - what it is and what is not. Then we describe the maturity scale for each skill. In some cases the skills build on each other. In others, the skill is more like a sliding scale. Finally, we give you some conversational guidance on how to explore the tech lead's capabilities and maturity with each skill.

### Listening

Just as we advise our coaches to be strong listeners, your tech lead should be a strong listener as well. 

Communication is said to be the hallmark of leadership, and communication has many aspects to it, including speaking and listening. But listening is the most important of the two components because it is through listening that a tech lead is able to gather the raw material he or she needs to take action.

We cannot overemphasize this skill enough because it is the foundation of all leadership activites that follow. 

So many tech leads (and other leaders, for that matter) get hung up on making right choices or go out and execute on the wrong path. Most of these anxieties or errors could be solved if the tech lead had better information. And the only way to get that information is for the tech lead to listen carefully to what their engineers, their other team members, and their management is saying. 

#### The Listening Maturity Scale - Stacking

The scale for this skill is a stacking scale, which is to say that each skill builds on the next.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads tend to focus primarily on the content of what others say. For example, the tech lead may only recall facts, figures, data provided by others. There is nothing wrong with starting at this level because it is obviously important to remember exactly the words or data being transmitted by others. Indeed, some tech leads struggle even at this level either because they either (1) do not solicit information or data from others or (2) when they do receive data or information they disregard, ignore, or forget it. 

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads are able to not only receive facts and data but are able to have a stronger comprehension and memory of the nuances of the context of communication as well some of the non-verbal signals such as body language. Attaining this level is difficult for almost everyone, but it is a powerful skill for leads.

At the **advanced** level, we challenge tech leads to listen at the level that you we advise to start at with coaching (which is part of why we believe learning to be an effective coach could be so impactful for your own leadership). Recall that the definition of "empathic" listening is actually pretty simple, despite the fact that all humans struggle with it. For the tech lead to reach this advanced maturity they need to be able to hear what others say and put their own needs aside for a moment. 

For example, in the advanced level, the tech lead may be communicating with another engineer on the team. He or she is able to read the context and non-verabl signal with skill but to be empathic, the tech lead needs to not let his or her needs. Those needs may include:
1. Concerns about his or her capabilities as a lead
2. Concerns about deadlines or pressures
3. Irritations about what the other person is saying
4. Needing the other person to do something they are not doing

The list of possible distractions is endless but the effect is the same. The tech lead cannot truly hear what the other person is saying if the tech lead's needs are more important to him or her than what the other person is saying. And the same is true for you as a coach.

#### How To Explore Listening in Your Coaching

As we said, this a **crucial** skill to test your tech lead on. Here are some tips on how to explore it:

1. If he or she is struggling with something, ask what information he or she is using and where he or she got it.
2. If it was through listening, challenge the tech lead to push through the content of what he or she heard to what was actually said by others. 
3. Ask them to see how clearly they understood the context of the communication. 
4. What was the body language of the others? 
5. When the other people were talking, what was running through his or her mind. If they can remember their own thoughts better than the signals being sent by the others, then this could be a sign of immaturity with the skill

Reflect on the responses to those questions and think about about their responses align to the stacking maturity scale for this skill.

### Taking Initiative/Ownership

Taking initiative sounds like a checkbox on an annual performance report, but it is truly an impact skill for the tech lead to develop. Leaders, once they have understanding from listening above, have impact by the choices and actions they take. Taking initiative is usually thought of as a skill we ask senior software engineers to focus on, but it remains a key skill to work on as a tech lead moves into the role. The initiative for a lead is more about put his or her team out there and being accountable for reaching for a result..

In some of our other material, podcasts, and the [Tech Lead Guide](../tech-leads), we encourage tech leads to spot and step into leadership moments. A simple way to assess whether your tech lead is doing this is by exploring how often and what kinds of initiative he or she is taking in certain moments.

In scaling approach for this skill, the first two maturities are the full scale: from doing nothing to doing too much. The third is the "middle way" of choosing only to take initiative on the kinds of activities where the tech lead knows he or she can have an impact.

#### The Sliding Maturity Scale of Initiative Taking

At the **beginner** level, tech leads may take very little initiative and, possibly when they do, they express considerable anxiety or reservations about the actions they are taking. Part of this conservative approach to initiative could be rooted in the tech lead's inexperience with the role and/or fear of failing when they take action. At this level as the coach, you can ask questions to strengthen the tech lead's confidence that the actions they take are good.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead is liberally taking initiative and stepping into many leadership moments. This can be very impactful in that the tech lead is probably very visible within his or her organization and may be known by a level of high energy or commitment, as evidenced by the sheer amount of "diving in" that the tech lead is doing. A lack of delegation is often the hallmark of this level as well.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead begins to realize that stepping into too many moments or taking too much initiative can be exhausting at best and career damaging at worst if the tech lead is spread so thin that he or she gets some bad results as of a lack of focus. So at this advanced level, the tech lead has the maturity to pick and choose as many opportunities as possible so long as they are able to follow through and have an impact with their team. This level may also be marked by increasing fluency with delegation.

#### How to Explore Initiative Taking in Your Coaching

Taking initiative is a simple skill to understand but it can often be a loaded term, so a way to conceptualize the skill while you are in the middle of the conversation is to imagine someone being completely passive or doing nothing at all in the situation being described.

1. When the tech lead is describing a challenging situation that seems to be happening around or to him or her, ask what he or she is doing to take action in the moment
2. If the team lead seems to be expressing a desire for something to be different or for some kind of outcome to happen, ask what actions he or she taking to bring into reality

### Vision

The flipside of listening is, of course, speaking. And one of the most important things that leaders do is to frame his or her understanding of situations and articulating a vision about how the team should move forward. 

The term "vision" seems to evoke images of grand speeches like Martin Luther King Jr.'s *I Have a Dream* speech, but this skill at this level of leadership that most tech leads are in is actually fairly bland, mundane, and routine activity. Articulating a vision as a skill is simply demands that the tech lead knowing what outcome he or she wants in a given situation, how effectively the tech lead can express that desire (ideally in a compelling way), and whether he or she is telling the team and how frequently.

#### The Vision Maturity Stacking Scale

Like listening, the maturity scale for the vision skill is a stacking one: each skill builds on the next.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads will either express no particular vision about any given situation or will articulate an uncompelling or unclear vision. If they do have a vision they may either not communicate it to the team or do so with considerable anxiety. This is an interesting area of leadership development because new tech leads may stifle their own inner voices about what they want because they are interrupted by whatever else is going on. But knowing what you want is a critical thing to be clear about as a leader so help them think it through.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead now has increased capabilities to articulate a vision that is not only clear and cogent but also has some compelling aspects to it. At this level, however, the tech lead may still be not communicating the vision frequently to his or her team or at all. Often, tech leads at this level underestimate how frequently their team needs to be reminded of the vision let alone taking the time to tell each team member how he or she fits into the vision.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead is able to articulate clear, compelling visions and frequently invokes the vision in challenging and routine situations. Moreover, the tech lead is able to adapt the vision's message to different constituencies (including management) as well as taking the time to individually explain to team members how their work fits into the vision -- no matter how grand or small that vision is.

#### How to Explore the Vision Skill in Your Coaching

This is a surprisingly hard skill, even for highly experienced leaders, but it is a relatively easy one to probe your tech lead on. When they describe a situation, ask them what their vision was. 
1. Assess whether you think the vision is clear or compelling
2. Ask them whether they told the team
3. Whether the team is clear on the vision and how they know (or don't)
4. Ask them how often they repeat the vision (and challenge for specific situations)
5. Then ask them what other moments they might have missed to articulate the vision

Since this skill is a fairly black and white activity they will do or not do, be careful not to put them on the defensive through your questioning. It may be helpful to start a conversation about this skill by referring them to the materials in their [Tech Lead's Guide](../tech-leads) so they understand the line of questioning without being too defensive.

### Tracking and Adjusting

A core, day to day activity for most tech leads is to track the team's activity and to make many small alignment adjustments to inviduals' work and/or reporting adjustments in either technology, schedules, or other technical issues to the next level of management or other consitutencies. 

It is *such* a routine activity for most tech leads that they may not even have a conscious awareness that they are doing it or whether they are effective in this skill.

#### The Tracking and Adjusting Stacking Maturity Scale
| Tracking and Adjusting | Relies excessively on technology | Face to face; slow to adjust | Fluidly adjusts and anticipates |

Growing in this skill is also a stacking set of skills.

At the **beginner** level, tech leads who lack maturity in this skill may rely excessively on technology. For example, the tech lead may rely heavily on comments to Github pull requests, comments on Trello cards, communicating via Slack, or agile tracking tools. It is possible that they truly believe the technology is an efficient form of communication. But at this level, they lack an understanding that to be effective, they have to engage in fairly inefficient face to face communications at times. The technology may be appropriate for the team, but the test is whether it the tech lead can switch to face to face meetings when needed.

At the **intermediate** level, tech leads exhibit more confidence in engaging in full bandwidth, live conversations more frequently. But they are slow to make adjustments during thos conversations. For example, the tech lead may believe that he or she needs an engineer to do something differently, but is reluctant to make that adjustment during that conversation because he or she fears a difficult conversation. Instead, the tech lead may return to his or her computer and ask for the change via Slack or email, or may not make the change at all.

At the **advanced** level, the tech lead is able to confidently "walk the halls" and engage in on the spot, live alignment adjustments that, even if they are somewhat confrontational, result in a stronger team. Moreover, when this skill is combined with maturity in the vision and listening skill, the tech lead is able to fluidly anticipate changes that need to happen before the moments become confrontational.

#### How to Explore the Tracking and Adjusting Skill in Your Coaching

Engaging your tech lead on this skill is typically a fairly easy conversation. 
1. Ask them to describe the day to day work and how they keep track of stuff
2. Probe for an understanding the extent of their reliance on technology and the reasons behind its us
3. Explore moments where they feel the method may fail them or be ineffective
4. Explore moments where they have to make corrections or adjustments in the work that their team is doing
5. How do they do it and how confident do they feel making those adjustments

### The Tech Lead's Invididual Growth Mindset
| Individual Growth Mindset | Goal driven | Process driven | Grows team's capabilities |

This is not so much of a skill as a capability or a mindset that the tech lead has. It has a tinge of a new age feel to it, but it is actually very practical and critically important to the tech lead's maturity growth in the four skills. It has to do with the mindset that the tech lead brings to work with him or her every day and to what extent he or she is able to see their own leadership grow. 

We add it the Pareto capabilities because (1) it helps you and the tech lead understand how their growth will be shaped in the role and (2) it is the foundation for higher levels of impact in their leadership.

#### The Indidivual Growth Mindset Sliding Scale

This scale is more like a sliding one in that the tech lead may land on any given position depending on the context.

At the **beginner** level, the tech lead is motivated almost entirely on hitting goals, whether those goals were given to the team by management or the tech lead articulated those goals to the team through vision setting. This is the position most of us are in almost all the time, so there is nothing wrong with this level. And besides, hitting goals is a very impactful way to get a lot done! There are some downsides to this level, however, in that the goal focus can, sometimes, impede the tech lead's ability to build a team, and so the goal achievement may be uneven.

At the **intermediate** level, the tech lead's motivation changes and rather than placing a goal driven approach at the pinnacle of his or her leadership, the tech lead begins to focus on the process for hitting goals. The process could be the individual's process for approaching the team, or the process for the team itself. Agile methods tend to put the focus on this level, so you may have to probe a little further to see if the tech lead is treating a retro a yet another goal to check off or a true moment to inspect and adapt.

At the **advanced** level, the the tech lead is committed to not only his or her own growth but in growing leadership on the team itself. At this point, you may want to encourage the tech lead to step up and start coaching through the Tech Lead Coaching Network.


#### How to Explore the Tracking and Adjusting Skill in Your Coaching

I heard an analogy recently that may be helpful for you while you are having a conversation. Imagine a farm whether there are only two types of animals: cows and horses. The cows are pretty slow moving and seem perfectly content standing around chewing their cud. By contrast, the horses want to run, play, fight, and generally explore. The tech lead's growth mindset could be considered similar. Do you feel they are striving to grow or do they just want to check the box to say they hit the goal or didn't.

This is one area where you may not be able to do much as a coach -- remember you are not a therapist and your objective is not to probe the future or the past. People's mindsets take a lifetime to create and take time to change -- and can only be changed if they want. And do not judge the tech lead if they are relatively immature on this scale. We all have our valid reasons for the way we see life.

Thus you may not be able to truly coach them to a different level; however, if you hear immature (cow-like) responses of comments that frustrate you, there are many positive questions you can ask to encourage them to see their growth capability as more dynamic. Understanding this scale will help you understand the progress in the other areas and how to tailor your approach.
